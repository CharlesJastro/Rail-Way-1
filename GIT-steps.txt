1. Navigate to the work folder and do    git init    to initialise git. This creates a hidden .git folder. Using   dir -force   in cmd shows all including hidden folders like the .git folder.
2. Do   git status   to see the current git status of the files in directory. Red files have not been added to git while green files have been added.
3. Do   git add app.js   where app.js is the file name here that I want to add to the staging area.

5. Do   git log   to see what files have been committed to git.
